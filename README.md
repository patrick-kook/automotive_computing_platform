# Automotive Computing Platform

This project involves hands-on implementation of a vehicle control system using CAN (Controller Area Network), RTOS (Real-Time Operating System), and OP-TEE (Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment). 

The goal of the project was to design and demonstrate control logic between multiple ECUs (Electronic Control Units) communicating through CAN. Each ECU operates under an RTOS environment, handling real-time tasks and secure execution using OP-TEE.

Key features:
- Practical implementation of CAN-based ECU-to-ECU communication
- Development of vehicle control logic under RTOS
- Secure message handling using OP-TEE TAs (Trusted Applications)
- Real-world simulation of automotive control scenarios
